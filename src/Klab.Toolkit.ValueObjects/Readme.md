# Klab.Toolkit.ValueObjects

## Purpose

This project is a part of the Klab.Toolkit solution and is used to define value objects. Value objects are immutable objects that are defined by their attributes. They are used to represent concepts that are not defined by their identity but by the attributes they have. For example, a date range is defined by its start and end date. With value objects, we can ensure that the attributes are valid and that the object is immutable.
