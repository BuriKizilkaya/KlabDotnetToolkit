# Klab.Toolkit.Common

## Purpose

This project is a part of the Klab.Toolkit solution and is used to define common classes and interfaces that are used across the solution. For example, the `ITimeProvider` interface is defined here and is used to abstract the system time. This is useful for testing and for making the system more flexible.
